## Model 1 ROM Disassembled

This repository contains reverse engineered source code for Tandy TRS-80 Model 1 Level 2 BASIC ROMS. 

This source code has support for both V1.3 (the default), and V1.2 of the ROMS. For more information on the 
differences see references below. Several additional (optional) patches can be applied (e.g. FreHD autoboot)
be setting a #DEFINE in the code

### Motivation

I read a post asking why Model 1 BASIC hadn’t been ported to a modern hobbyist CP/M environment. Of course there are 
many reasons why this has not been done but one of the issues is (after doing a search) I could not locate original 
source code, which would be needed for such a port. I did locate several disassemblies, but none we adequately 
complete, and would 

I am unsure why the original source code has not been published (in its original form), since the ROM contents have 
been very heavily documented over the years. However, this repository aims to address this.

### Description

Main Features
* Fully Compilable Source Code for Model 1 Level 2 12KB ROMS

Supports
* Both 1.3 and 1.2 versions, plus EACA clone hardware.

While based of a disassembly (which can be low quality) the following work has been done: 
* Replaced all disassembler generated labels with meaningful labels
* Ensured all jumps (JR and JP) reference valid code labels.
* Replaced all $3xxx hardware references with `.EQU` definitions
* Replaced all $4xxx buffer references with `.EQU` definitions, with a single `.EQU $4000` reference
* Replaced all generated op-code with Byte `.DB` definitions for DataTables/Text/Constants/Etc
* Added code documentation from various sources at the code block / function level
* Replaced incorrect op-codes, where Better Else "Trick" was used. See Reference below.

On the last point I was unaware of these optimisations until I worked on this code.

## Compiling

This source code has been compiled with Telemark Assembler, and tested using a DIFF tool to ensure binary
compatibility of the generated output.

### Build Options

There are several `DEFINE`'s that can be set in the code (very start) to enable certain features.
By default the build will create a Version 1.3

The base ROM version can be defined.
* `#DEFINE VER12` - uncomment this the degrade from V1.3 to V1.2 of the ROM.
* `#DEFINE EACA80` - uncomment to enable Dick Smith System-80 (EACA) hardware support. 
  NOTE: While not mandatory you should also define `VER12` since the System-80 ROM was based on V1.2.
  V1.3 has not been formally tested, but assume should work, and opens ability to also specify `FREHDBT`  

There are several optional features.
* `#DEFINE FREHDBT` - Enables the FreHD auto boot feature, i.e. the Auto boot ROM. This requires version 1.3 
  ROM as a base, please do NOT define `VER12` 
  Consider also enabling NMIHARD to ensure reset (on non-floppy machine) will force a reset.
* `#DEFINE NMIHARD` - Set NMI (reset) as always perform a hard reset. Normally on non-floppy systems NMI performs
  a soft reset returing to the `READY>` prompt with the basic program intact. This is useful in system without 
  floppy disk to force a full reset (0066h)
* `#DEFINE LOWCASE` - Disable Alpha character translation of letters A-Z,a-z to the values on range 00h to 1Fh. 
  This is useful when a lower case mod is installed, but an alternate video driver has not been installed, 
  or where the font rom on the machine has the alternate characters in the 00h 1Fh range (0471h)

Some additional defines, which are build options rather than features
* `#DEFINE SIZE16K` - Will pad the end of the rom with $FF to 16KB size. useful if want to append multiple ROM 
  images for used in large 16K paged rom
* `#DEFINE DONTEND` - Disable `.END` directive if `#INCLUDE`ing the source inside another file.

Experimental - use at your own risk
* `#DEFINE _EMBED` - Strip all HW, and IO routines leaving just BASIC language as standalone code
  and used in L2 Basic for CP/M

## Extensions

### L2 Basic for CP/M

I have created an implementation of Level 2 Basic that runs as an executable CP/M 2.2 (or greater). 

Switch to the branch "cpmbasic" which takes this source code and you will find TBASIC.Z80 which will
compile to a CP/M COM executable file. It is not well documented (see in the the ASM file), it has many
limitations but does work. 

i.e. You do need to be careful though RAM starts at 3000H (not 4000H), so POKE's to what would normally be video
RAM would easily corrupt your program

It also includes the LOAD filename.bas which will load a TRS-80 basic program.

## Fine Print

### Legal

The source code is NOT the original code, it is a derivative work assembled from multiple sources.
By providing this code I do not claim any ownership of the original code, those rights belong with
the original authors.

### Contributing

If you wish to improve the quality of this source code (better documentation) I  would be happy to accept Pull Requests,
please ensure you test that the build works using Telemark Assembler.
